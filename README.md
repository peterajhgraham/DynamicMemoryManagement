# Dynamic Memory Management

This repository focuses on managing dynamic memory allocation in C using malloc, realloc, and free. This program processes an array of integers, allowing the user to add, remove, and search for elements, along with printing the array's contents, displaying its summary statistics, and at the end it will release all allocated memory.
